I'm excited to announce the release of AutStr, a Python library for symbolic manipulation of infinite mathematical structures using automata theory.

## What is AutStr?
AutStr brings the power of automatic structures research to Python, enabling:

**üî¢ Infinite Arithmetic**
- Native algebraic interface for B√ºchi integer arithmetic
- Solve linear equations over ‚Ñ§ with base-2 encoding
- Symbolic implementation of algorithms like the Sieve of Eratosthenes

**ü§ñ Automatic Presentations**
- Represent infinite domains and relations via finite automata
- Evaluate FO(‚àû) queries ("there exist infinitely many x")
- Dynamically update relations during evaluation
- Serialize compiled results for reuse

**‚ö°Ô∏è Sparse Automata Backend**
- JAX-accelerated automata operations
- Space-efficient representation via default transitions
- Integrated visualization capabilities

### Quick Example
```python
from autstr.arithmetic import x, y
R = (x + y == 10)  # Infinite solution set
print(R.is_finite())  # False
print((5, 5) in R)   # True
```

Install: `pip install autstr`

## Who is it for?
AutStr is perfect for researchers and anyone exploring computable infinite structures, especially in model theory, logic, and theoretical computer science.

## How does AutStr compare?
| Feature         | AutStr                  | SymPy/Z3                |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Domain          | Infinite structures     | Finite/closed-form math |
| Representation  | Automata-based         | Symbolic expressions    |
| Quantifiers     | Native ‚àû-quantifiers   | ‚àÄ/‚àÉ with limitations    |
| Solutions       | Entire solution sets    | Single solutions        |
| Specialty       | Decidable infinite models | General math/SAT     |

**When to use AutStr:**
- For infinite domains (‚Ñ§, ‚Ñö, trees)
- When you need complete solution sets
- For FO(‚àû) queries

**Not for:**
- Logic fragments where highly optimized solvers exist

SymPy/Z3 excel at symbolic algebra and SAT, while AutStr specializes in automata-representable infinities and first-order logic with specialized quantifiers. They complement, not replace, each other.
